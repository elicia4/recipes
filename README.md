# odin-recipes

This is a Project about building a basic recipe website using HTML only.
It consists of a main page with links to a few recipes. 

I will hopefully be able to implement the following:
- an HTML boilerplate
- lists
- images
- links
- headers
- ...and other useful elements previously learned
